A store announces a sale campaign whereby any customer who buys two items gets 50% off on the cheaper one. 
If the customer buys more than two items, he/she must group them into pairs of two to indicate the items that 
the oer should apply to.

Suppose you want to buy n items in total. Write a method that will give you the best pairing of the items (the 
one with the minimum price). The method's signature is:

	public static LinkedList<ItemPair> minPairing(LinkedList<Item> items).

If you leave it up to the store owner, he/she will try to pair the items in order to obtain the maximum price. 
Write a method that will help the store owner achieve this. The method's signature is:

	public static LinkedList<ItemPair> maxPairing(LinkedList<Item> items).

How much will you gain if you use your method (instead of the shop owner's method) for the following list of item 
prices: 60 $, 100 $, 400 $, 600 $, 200 $, 80 $.

Using the following classes:

public class Item {
    private int id;
    private double price;

    public Item (int id, double price ) {
        this.id = id;
        this. price = price;
    }
    int getId () {
        return id;
    }
    double getPrice () {
        return price;
    }
}
and the class :

public class ItemPair {
    public Item first;
    public Item second;

    public ItemPair (Item first, Item second ) {
        this. first = first;
        this. second = second;
    }
}
